    <h4>About Me:</h4>
     <p> 
        I was born and raise in Louisville, KY before moving to the Northern Kentucky/Greater Cincinnati area in grade school. 
        I have a son who is nine years old, he is my motivation to continue to push and better myself so that I can provide the best possible 
        life for him. I have always had an interest in techonology in general, but I have always really been fasinated with creating websites.
        Everytime I look at a well put together webpage, I always wondered how the developers went about creating it; so I am very excited to 
        participate in this to learn how to do so myself.
     </p>

    </div>

    <p> This is one of my favorite songs becasue it has a personal meaning behind it. Ever since my son started going to school, I would play
        this song every day on the way to dropping him off. <br> 
        I played it hoping to not only calm any nerves he may have, but any I my have as well. 
        Also to remind us that, no matter what may happen in life, at the end of the day, everything will hopefully be alright. </p>
